  <h1>Before the Shadows</h1>
  <p>
    The world of the Expressed began well before the Society, before we followed the Pillars, and before the
    formation of the original Grand Council. What was this time like? What happened in this time before the
    shadows, before the One Law? Perhaps, more importantly, what about this time shaped our lives as they
    are now; and how did each Expression come to exist? These things and more will be covered here in our
    historical origins known as ancient history.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ancient history for the Expressed overlaps with the history of Man. Though many things stated here
    will seem to contradict the mundane histories you have learned, be aware that they do not unless ample
    proof exists for us to believe otherwise. Also know, the spin doctors over in Obscura have done their best
    to keep the most damning of this evidence out of the history books. While most of you will not be familiar
    with fact that there were cities populated with Expressed and mundanes as far back as 39,000 BC,
    remember that until recently you were also unfamiliar with the fact that Vampyres, Sorcerers, and shape shifters are real.
  </p>
  <p>
    That being said, sit back and enjoy the ride as I take you through the wonders that are our most ancient of histories.

  <h1>A History</h1>
  <p>
    These pages—once passed around as a heavily guarded manuscript—are no longer confined to dusty shelves or hidden
    archives. They've been updated for the times, translated into a format more suited to the modern world. Some will
    call that reckless. Others, necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    When this manual existed only in printed form, it was already controversial. In certain Realms, even possessing a
    copy was considered a direct violation of the First Pillar, the One Law. Now that it’s available online—well, let’s
    just say the risks haven’t diminished.
  </p>
  <p>
    Why make it available at all, then? Because despite the dangers it may pose, knowledge still matters. And because
    our past mistakes cannot be allowed to repeat.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Society, for all its mystery, has survived in part because we’ve kept our stories alive—through memory, through
    whispers, through guarded teaching. But oral tradition can only go so far. Tales change in the retelling. Pieces are
    forgotten, others altered to suit those in power. Some truths were lost. Others were buried.
  </p>
  <p>
    This version doesn’t claim to be definitive. It’s a starting point—a foundation for those new to the Society, and a
    reminder for those who’ve forgotten why we guard what we do. You’ll find contradictions, gaps, even disagreements
    among the stories shared here. But within each, there’s a trace of the truth. A thread of something real.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’re unfamiliar with our world, you may be tempted to dismiss all of this as fiction. A setting for a game. A
    strange creative project. And if that helps you sleep better, you’re welcome to read it that way. But know this:
    your disbelief doesn’t make these things any less real.
  </p>
  <p>
    To the initiated—read carefully. Reflect deeply. Ask questions. The Society’s greatest danger has never been from
    outside forces. It’s been from within, from forgetting who we are and how close we’ve come to losing everything
    before.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let this be a light in the dark. Just don’t mistake it for the whole truth. There’s always more beneath the surface.
    Before we go any further, there is three things you need to know if we want to make sure you survive to see tomorrow.
    A vital code each of us lives by to make sure the bit of safety we have carved out in this world doesn't come
    crumbling down. We call them, the Three Pillars.
