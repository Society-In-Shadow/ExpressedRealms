  <h1>About Game</h1>
  <p>
    Society in Shadows is a Live Action Role Playing game set in the modern day of our world. We are an urban fantasy
    setting, with elements of secrecy and politics, but with a penchant for saving the world. Players can range from a
    former pirate to a mad scientist recreating Tesla experiments, but the sky is the limit with your imagination.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Society in Shadows rules utilize a six stones game system intended to serve as tools and guidelines for game
    officials and players. The goal is for everyone to have fun and weave a good story. Before playing the game each
    player will create their own character, utilizing the rules found within this website. Beyond play with your local
    community your character can be played at any official Society in Shadows events held at various conventions
    throughout the Midwest and gain experience as a part of an ongoing Chronicle told with players from all over the
    region! Help and discussion can be found on our discord linked in the upper right hand corner of the site.
  </p>
  <p>
    Society in Shadows events typically take place over the entire weekend of an event or convention, and our players
    will be able to participate in scenes of combat, investigation, political intrigue and more with other players all
    throughout the event space. Players may hop in or hop out of play using badges they are given at check-in so they
    can participate in other events without interruption.
  </p>
  <p>
    Events are facilitated by our Game Officials or GOs (G-Oh)s, they will be moving around the event spaces with plenty of
    things for you to participate in, and to help you accomplish what you want to work towards. Feel free to ask them
    questions at any time! We are working on a digital tool to manage and run your character sheet throughout the
    convention, and having mobile phone or device with internet access is encouraged, all resources needed to play the
    game at an event will be provided (This includes a printed character sheet, a bag of six stones, a character badge,
    and resource tracking strips)!
  </p>
  <p>
    Society in Shadows conventions are contained in something we call a Chronicle - a collection of stories take place
    at these conventions over the course of a few years. Think of it like a TTRPG campaign, except with many more
    players! We are kicking off this chronicle in August 2025! You may play the same character over the course of an
    entire chronicle, however be aware the Society in Shadows can be a dangerous place, lethality is expected! But not
    to fear, even if your character faces their demise you can always create a new character and see the world from
    fresh eyes!
  </p>
  <p>
    We strive to create an open, friendly atmosphere and welcome new players to try us out at many conventions across
    the Midwestern area. Players are encouraged to dress up in an outfit befitting them, though that is not a requirement
    for play.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not tolerate any form of discrimination, whether that be Homophobia, Transphobia, Racism, Ablism, Sexism, etc.
    Our main rule is to have fun, and not to infringe on others doing so as well.
  </p>

  <h1>History</h1>
  <p>
    Society in Shadows has been around since the mid 1990's.  We've had players from Kansas City all the way to
    Minneapolis and further. With a former peak of 87 players and averaging around 30-40 players, and after a brief
    interim, we have returned, better than ever. Our Main Staff has been playing the game for many years, and have been
    hard at work making this the best iteration of the game it can be.
  </p>

  <h1>Who We Are</h1>
  <p>
    We are a dedicated group of former players who are working to once more help bring back a game that has been beloved,
    cherished and has helped inspire us with the world and stories told within it.  The core group working towards
    resurrecting the game have previously played the 6 stones ran incarnation of the game for many years and we want to
    continue the legacy of that while continuing to expand and grow the game that we all fell in love with. Our goal is
    to have an accessible and inclusive LARP where everyone is able to tell collaborative stories no matter your
    experience level with the medium
  </p>

  <h1>Concerns</h1>
  <p>
    For those under the age of 18, we do require Parental Consent from a legal Guardian. We do inform our staff, and
    ask that all players treat the younger ones with respect, and keep their language clean and appropriate around them.
    We do ask for an emergency contact in case things go awry and you inform us of any potential concerns as well.
    (i.e. medical, physical)
