  <h1>Who We Are</h1>
  <p>
    We are a dedicated group of players who are working to bring our beloved game to the world. We have all played for 
    many a year, and have stepped up to the reins to help guide this organization into a new format and a more enjoyable 
    LARP
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      We are not an action based LARP, instead more focused on inter-character roleplay with an intent to be more
      disability friendly.
    </strong>

  <h1>About Game</h1>
  <p>
    Society in Shadows (SiS) is a game set in the modern day of our world. We are an urban fantasy setting, with 
    elements of secrecy and politics, but with a penchant for saving the world. Players can range from a former 
    pirate to a mad scientist recreating Tesla experiments, but the sky is the limit with your imagination.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each player has an opportunity to create a character that has an “Expression,” of which there are Six in total. 
    They then get to choose from an array of powers, and using them normally requires a test, using our unique “Six 
    Stone” system for success vs. failure.
  </p>
    
  <h1>General Expectations</h1>
  <p>
    We strive to create an open, friendly atmosphere and welcome new players to try us out at many conventions across 
    the Midwestern area. Players are encouraged to dress up in an outfit befitting them, though that is not a 
    requirement for play.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not tolerate any form of discrimination, whether that be Homophobia, Transphobia, Racism, Ablism, Sexism, 
    etc. Our main rule is to have fun, and not to infringe on others doing so as well.

  <h1>Concerns</h1>
  <p>
    For those under the age of 18, we do require Parental Consent from a legal Guardian. We do inform our staff, and 
    ask that all players treat the younger ones with respect, and keep their language clean and appropriate around them.
    We do ask for an emergency contact in case things go awry and you inform us of any potential concerns as well. 
    (i.e. medical, physical)

  <h1>History</h1>
  <p>
    Society in Shadows is a long running Live Action RolePlaying game boasting players from Kansas City all the way to 
    Minneapolis and further. With a former peak of 87 players and averaging around 30-40 players, and after a brief 
    interim we have returned, better than ever. Our Main Staff has been playing the game for many years, and have been 
    hard at work making this the best iteration of the game it can be.
