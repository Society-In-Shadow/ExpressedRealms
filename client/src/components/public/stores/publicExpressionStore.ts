Ranging from a physical master of their body to the ability to help others with but a touch, the Adept can do a lot, allowing them to fly across the field, dodge bullets, and crush others with their minds. Think 80s Action movie or the wizened old head of a monastery when you imagine what abilities an Adept can utilize.',

Ranging from Immortal warriors who have fought in major wars, to the Generals of old able to voice commands from afar, these people can also curse their foes to weaken their very essence. An Aeternari also feeds off the very life essence of others, needing to consume a little every day, though the Society does provide a safe method to do so. Think of these like the eternal warrior fighting to remain on top, or those with commanding voices that speak to the very soul of others.',

Able to use the plants and animals around, they can heal others and control the field while in human form, but all have a connection to an animal, and some choose to indulge in the beast within, using it to be faster, tougher, and stronger.

Given the ability to divert attention and fool the senses, the Sidhe make the choice at higher levels to devote towards a more physical manifestation or the more trickery based ones. With the ability to create armor and weaponry from thin air, alongside the capability to turn the eye away from others, Sidhe can find their fit in many groups.

Having to deal with a Bloodthirst that creeps up and needing to feed regularly creates an interesting dynamic between them and others.
