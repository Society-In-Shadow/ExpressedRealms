# High Level Overview

## Frontend

The frontend is built using Vue 3 and Vite.  It primarily uses PrimeVue and Boostrap for styling and layout.

Locally, it can be found at this address

* [Front End / Web App](https://localhost/)

## Backend / Web API

Backend is using .Net 8, using a combination of Use Cases for business logic, and repositories to consolidate common
ef core operations.

* Use Case Details can be found [here](/useCases.md)
* Repository standards can be found [here](/repositoryStandards.md)

The API is built using Minimal APIs, following the restful api pattern.

The swagger documentation is being used to document the API.

Fluent Validations and Fluent Results are used extensively to validate and pass around the data in the backend.

Locally, swagger can be found at this address

* [Back End / Web API / Swagger](https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html)

## Database

We are using Postgres for the database, and using PgAdmin locally to manage it.

The codebase interacts with it via Entity Framework Core.

The database for the most part is a dumb one, all business logic should be handled in the repositories.

Locally, PgAdmin can be found at this address

* [DB Management / pgAdmin](http://localhost:8888/login?next=%2Fbrowser%2F)

### More Information

* More information on how we use it can be found in the [Database](database.md) documentation
* More information on how Migrations work can be found in the [Migrations](migrations.md) documentation
* More information on how we use EF Core can be found in the [EF Core Practices](efCorePractices.md) documentation

## Auditing

In here we have user logs, that keep track of admin related actions and anything to do with modifying none user specific
data.

We are using a library called Audit.Net, that integrates with EF Core.

At it's core, it keeps track of changes on the column level for all tables.

I have a wrapper around that to make it easier to use, and make sure that it outputs a user activity log.

More information on how we use the Audit Framework can be found in the [EF Core Practices](efCorePractices.md) documentation

## Testing

### Unit Tests

We have unit tests in both the front end and backend.

The github actions will run them on every push to a PR, and they must all be passing to merge

See [Backend Unit Testing](backendUnitTesting.md) for how we have the backend setup.
See [Vitests](vitesting.md) for how we do generic frontend tests.

### Component Tests

Cypress is being used for component testing.  When writing these, we are looking for complete coverage of the functional
part of the page.  This means that we are not testing the styling or the layout.  This means testing to make sure that
all fields are filled out, error messages are being displayed, data is being saved, actions are correctly connected up
and so on.

See [Component Testing](componentTesting.md) for more information about how we use it here

### End to End Tests

End to end tests are also using Cypress.  As of writing, they do some basic checks, but not really maintained as much.

See [Cypress](cypress.md) for more information about how we use it here

## Feature Flags

We use a product called Flipt. It's free to host locally and out on production. The free hosting locally is the main drive
for using it, as each dev can have their own instance.

There is a custom wrapper around that system, that does a couple of different things:

* Allows us to define feature flags code side, and upon deployment, it will update the feature flag instance
* Centralized the feature flag logic into a central project
* Frontend has also been configured to look at the feature flag instance

In addition to hosting this locally at the address down below, we are also hosting it out in production.

* [Feature Flags](http://localhost:8050)

## Notifications

For this application, there isn't much in terms of notifications.  As of right now, it just user registrations

Locally, we are using a product called Mailpit to view the emails that are being sent

* [Mailpit](http://localhost:8025)

And out on prod we are using a product called Postmark

## CI/CD

We are using github actions for CI/CD.  The github actions are located in the .github/workflows folder.

# Hosting

## Docker Compose (Local)

Locally, everything is running via docker containers.  All services should be configured through that.

See more information in the [Docker](docker.md) documentation

## Azure

For our production environment, we rely on Azure.  Main components are the azure container apps for both front end and
back end projects.  We do have an application insights instance and use azure key vault and azure blob storage.

## Application Insights
Application Insights can be tested locally, by setting the "TEST-APP-INSIGHTS-LOCALLY" in the docker compose file to
true.  At that point, you will see the data being sent to app insights in the app log (eg console output in the docker 
container).

This is custom functionality that can be found in the "DebugTelementryChannel" class.  This was thrown together while 
trying to debug route template information for app insights. 

It's being kept in place just in case we need it again to debug something else.
